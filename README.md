The ecological footprint is used to measure how much the world's population demands from the ecosystem and how much it needs to recover. While measuring the ecological footprint, human-demanded areas include plant-based foods, fiber foods, large and small ruminants, marine products, forest products such as timber, and building.  This also adds to how much forests absorb carbon emissions from fossil fuels. All these are the sources people demand from the world. While consuming these resources, we need to contribute to the life cycle of the world. In doing so, it is important to carry out studies that will contribute to soil, air and water biologically. They are all included in the ecological footprint. Ecological footprint is basically a method which is formed to calculate the burden of a certain population to the nature.

A city, state or nationâ€™s bio capacity represents the productivity of its ecological assets (including cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land). These areas, especially if left unharvest, can also absorb much of the waste we generate, especially our carbon emissions.
There is a relationship between ecological footprints and its components. The determinants of the ecological footprint can be count as; country, regional or geographical conditions, Human development Index, Gross domestic product per capita etc..

the relationship between the ecological footprint and the various components, the relationship between the level of development and the responsibility of the countries, and the factors such as regional factors, population, and development level will be tried to reach the productive information.

What is HDI (Human Development Index) and What does it indicate?


The HDI is a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.  HDI gives an idea of the quality of life and I will try to understand in the R script whether the quality of life has an impact on the sense of responsibility towards the environment. In countries.csv  there are HDI values of many countries and continents.


What is Rate of Ecological Footprint ?


Rate of Ecological Footprint is an individual's responsibility to the environment. Therefore, even if a crowded country is unclean, the individual's responsibility for one individual in that country may be more responsible for someone who lives in a cleaner country than the less populated and dirty.


Conclusion


HDI specifies the level of development of the country's population and we can expect the HDI to be more accountable to the environment from the higher societies. At the same time, another population group that has to bear responsibility for the environment is the places where the ecological footprint is found to be high level. As a result of this study, I came to the conclusion that people should have more responsibility for the environment in the regions where human development index and ecological footprint is high. The responsibility graph in the last part of the R code gives an idea about which region should have more responsibility. According to the chart, Latin America people are the most responsible group against the world because of the high HDI and ecological footprint in Latin America.  Then with the order, Asia and Pacific comes to European Union, Northern and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Central Asia, and lastly Africa.
